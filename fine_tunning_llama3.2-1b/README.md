Chatbot with Fine-Tuned Language Model

This repository contains a chatbot implementation powered by a fine-tuned language model using Hugging Face's transformers library. The chatbot is capable of generating conversational responses to user inputs. The project demonstrates fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on custom datasets and deploying it for real-world use cases.

Features

Fine-tunes a pre-trained language model (e.g., LLaMA) using Hugging Face.

Customizable with your own dataset in JSONL format.

Efficient training using peft for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA).

Interactive chatbot for real-time conversation.
